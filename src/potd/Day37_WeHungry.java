 * We Hungry
 * Along with music one of the things we all do on a daily basis is eat.
 * Eatting the same ole thing day in and day out can get kind of boring.
 * Let's see if we can prevent that from happening with a Problem of the Day suggestion courtesy of Reddit user w1ndwak3r.
 * Today's goal is given a recipe name, find a set of ingredients for that recipe.
 * There are several great APIs out there to help you with this.
 * One that I found helpful is Food2Fork's API.
 * Feel free to use any means you'd like to obtain the data including writing a database of your own recipes!
 * Here is an API key (limited to 500 requests/day) for Food2Fork and some sample queries to get you started.
