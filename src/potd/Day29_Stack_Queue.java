/**
 * Stacks && Queues
 * Glad you're back for another great week!
 * Today's problem is about combining two common data structures in to one.
 * Your goal is to implement a data structure that can pop and push like a stack
 * and also dequeue and enqueue like a queue.
 * Here is an example of how your data structure should work.
 * store.push(5)
 * > [5]
 * store.enqueue(6)
 * > [5,6]
 * store.push(7)
 * > [7,5,6]
 * store.pop()
 * > 7
 * store.dequeue()
 * > 5
 * 
 * Note: pop and dequeue will essentially do the same thing since they always pull from the front of the line. As always, bonus points for efficiency!
