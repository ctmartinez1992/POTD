/**
 * 2 Stacks 1 Queue
 * Let's try and take a different spin on yesterday's problem.
* Today's goal will be to implement a stack.
* Then using two instances of the stack you'll want to mimic the functionality of a queue.
* Thus your queue will have an enqueue and dequeue method but those methods will only use the push and pop functionality of your stacks.
