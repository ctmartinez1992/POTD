/**
 * Sort Times
 * Woohoo it's Monday!!! We've got some interesting problems coming up this week so let's get started.
 * The owner of a 24 hour gym has coming to us asking for some help.
 * The owner needs to list the gym's class schedule in a sorted order.
 * The classes start at noon (12) and go to 3 in the morning.
 * Given an array of integers 0-23 inclusive,
 * sort them so that you start at 12 and go to 11, wrapping from 23 to 0.
 * Sample input:
 * [2,1,12,3,16,19,23]
 * Sample output:
 * [12,16,19,23,1,2,3]
 * For a bonus convert the times to a pretty string representation such as 16 = 4pm
 *
