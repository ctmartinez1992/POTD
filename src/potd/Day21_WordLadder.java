/**
 * Word Ladder
 * Comment previewing has arrived!!! Now on to our regularly scheduled problem.
 * Today we'll be designing a function that takes in two words and determines if
 * it's possible to transform one word in to the other by changing one letter at a
 * time (letters can not be added or removed, only changed).
 * When a letter is changed the new word must also be a valid word.
 * Each letter index can only be changed one time.
 * Here is an example using "power" and "tuned":
 * power -> tower -> towed -> toned -> tuned
 * Most Linux distros come with a built in dictionary or you can find one by searching the internet.
 * Here is one I found for English.
