/**
 * Rock Paper Scissors AI
 * Welcome back to another exciting Monday of Problem of the Day! Registration through Github is now open!
 * There are currently no features for registered users except for the fact that all your comments will be associated with your account.
 * As comment features come online you'll be able to make use of them on older posts with your account.
 * Today's goal is to build out the AI for our favorite childhood game, Rock Paper Scissors.
 * The AI for this program will keep track of the player's previous choices and then make its move based off that.
 * If a player chooses rock 3 times in a row then the AI should weight paper heavier when selecting its move. To prevent cheating,
 * the AI must make its decision before the player inputs their move.
 * For a bonus write the data to file so that your AI data can reflect over time.
 * A simple text file with 3 numbers indicating how many times each choice has been chosen will work or you can choose to do something more complex.
 * A quick recap for those who haven't played in awhile:
 *  Rock beats Scissors
 *  Scissors beats Paper
 *  Paper beats Rock
 *
