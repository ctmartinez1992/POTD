/**
 * Work Schedule
 * Our side project is doing well and we need to hire a few security guards to keep our sweet new office space secure.
 * It won't take more than one to secure the office.
 * Instead of juggling schedule requests for this position you write a program to handle it for you.
 * Below are the names of the security guards and their requested schedules for tomorrow.
 * Write a program so that one security guard is always on duty.
 * Feel free to adjust the input format as needed since this is your program after all.
 * Jack: ['0000-200', 500-1200]
 * Jackie: ['0000-600', '800-1300']
 * Marty: ['400-600', '1100-1600', '1700-2359']
 * Ronald: ['600-1200', '1300-1800', '1900-2359']
 * Ke$ha: ['1600-2359']
 * Tim: ['500-1200', '1530-1900', '2000-2300']
 * Snoo: ['700-900']
 * Some peoples shift may need to be cut short or start early but the times listed are the only hours they can work between (minimum 59min work shift).
 * For some fun bonus challenges optimize so that the most amount of people can work or the fewest amount of people can work.
